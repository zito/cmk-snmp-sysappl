description:
 This check monitors the running status of applications
 presented through SNMP SYSAPPL-MIB.

 Each application can have several runnning processes.
 The state of corresponding CheckMK service is {OK} if there are some running
 instances (processes). In the case of none running application instances
 the result will be {CRIT}.

 Unfortunately the final result of check not neccessarily corresponds
 with the health of the service. There maybe some zombie process etc…
 On the other hand, some blackbox appliance does not offer better view
 of internal state.

 The check uses the SNMP MIB {SYSAPPL-MIB::sysApplMIB}.

inventory:
 One service is created for every installed and running application.
